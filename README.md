### Using Greener:

User will need to sign in to create an account. They can then login into our React Native application manually or through Oauth. Once logged in, they will be redirected to the Collection page. Here they are given a starter Terrarium.

Once selected, they are taken to the Happy Terrarium page. It is here that they can perform actions on the plant they have selected and earn currency. Actions include: Water plant, Talk to Plant, and Sunlight.
